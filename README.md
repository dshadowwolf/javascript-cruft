javascript-cruft
================

a collection of bits and pieces of javascript I've written over the years

(the text-typer was run through jslint and cleaned up by my good friend David Ihnen)
(the text-typer has an odd bug in that IE11, at least, appears to fire off each timer
 twice and seems to run them at random if I add any instrumentation to the code)
