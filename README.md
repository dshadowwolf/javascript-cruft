javascript-cruft
================

a collection of bits and pieces of javascript I've written over the years

(the text-typer was run through jslint and cleaned up by my good friend David Ihnen)
(current version works in Chrome and Firefox - there seems to be an error with calculation of the ouput
 delays in IE11 that leads to it not functioning properly. Lets try increasing the delay and seeing if that
 changes things)
